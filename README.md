# DHStatsViewer

## What is it?
A long time ago (in 2018), I wanted to see how much I use Discord, so I made this.

## Usage
[Love2d](love2d.org) is required to run this. Simply install it and run `love .`

1. Scan and download your Discord history with [Discord History Tracker](https://dht.chylex.com/).
2. Open the app, click on the "Add Discord History" button
3. Drag-drop your DHT file
4. Once done, you can click on "Play loaded statistics" to view the graphs

### Note on using the tracker
DHT has been updated, this software requires the history to be in JSON format.  
It is known to be compatible with the [browser only version](https://dht.chylex.com/browser-only/) as the new desktop version provides a binary file as output.
